# NFS Client for Golang

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/go-nfs/nfsv3.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-nfs/nfsv3)

This is a collective of various improvement efforts by the individual contributors, to the [most prominent fork](github.com/vmware/go-nfs-client) of [github.com/davecheney/nfs](https://github.com/davecheney/nfs).

Original comment in the fork starts here:

> This is forked from and builds upon the work done [here](https://github.com/davecheney/nfs) which was put in the [public domain](https://github.com/davecheney/nfs/issues/1#issuecomment-280563247).
> 
> The objective is to build a minimal NFSv3 client.

## ⚠️Copyright and license⚠️　

This can be a complex problem; the very original is put in the public domain as stated in the above comment, the VMware's fork states that the copyright belongs to VMware, Inc., and pieces of code that only exist in this repository were written by the contributors who VMware doesn't affiliate.

Provisionally, we will continue to provide the code served under github.com/go-nfs/nfsv3 (call it Code hereafter) by 2-clause BSD license with the copyright notice intact.  However, this doesn't mean that VMware, Inc., is the sole copyright holder of Code and can gain full control over licensing of Code. This is because the contributors didn't seem to have signed CLA or any agreement akin. If you need to be sure about the licensing, please stick with the original.

As a side note, the above statement is not intended for us to combat with the big tech company. That's the rendering of gratitudes to the original author and the contributors, let alone the company (and its employee) which kept the code viable to date.
